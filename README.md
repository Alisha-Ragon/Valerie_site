# Valerie_site
Repo for creating Valerie's site
This is a copy cat of the "Recipe" project from Odin
Already in the project I have
- created a git repository
- cloned using my CLI and git commands
- Established a boilerplate in HTML
- used git commands to save to my repo
- worked alongside others to establish web content
